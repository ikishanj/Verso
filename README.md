# Verso

Abstract:
Verso dictionary is developed using Python. This script will help the user to get the meaning to his definition. When the user is writing an article and if he is unware of the particular word he want to use, this script will help him guide to the best possible word to finish his document or article
This is a prototype version. There are few limitations in this particular script. This script is developed to explain how we can work around with the words and give the user what he wants.
This product can be made into a full version by training the text or creating a data module. 
In order to improve the accuracy of the product, the user feedback can be made use to train the text and thus by time being this product can be evolved in to a more successful product.
